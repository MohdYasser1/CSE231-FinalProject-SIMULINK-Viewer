# Simulink Viewer

Simulink Viewer is a Java application that allows you to visualize Simulink models in a graphical format. It reads Simulink model files with the `.mdl` extension and displays the blocks and connections within the model.

## Features

- Displays blocks as rectangles with their names.
- Draws connections between blocks using lines and arrows. 
Here is an Example of what the Application should produce
![Example Image](/Screenshots/ExampleScreenshot)

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
- JavaFX library
- (Recommended) NetBeans 16 or above  

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your favorite Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse). I recommend to use NetBeans.
3. Make sure you have the JavaFX library added to the project dependencies.
4. Run the Project
5. You will be prompted to enter the path of the Simulink model file (`.mdl`). Provide the path and press Enter.
6. The Simulink Viewer application will open, displaying the blocks and connections from the model file.

## Usage

1. Once the application is running, you will see a graphical representation of the Simulink model.
2. Blocks are represented as rectangles, and their names are displayed inside the rectangles.
3. Connections between blocks are shown as lines with arrows indicating the flow direction.
4. Close the application to exit.

## Limitations

- The application currently supports Simulink model files with the `.mdl` extension only.
- The graphical representation may not accurately reflect the exact layout and styling of the original Simulink model.
- Advanced Simulink features and block types may not be fully supported.
